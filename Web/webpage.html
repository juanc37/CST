<h1>Welcome to the Coffee Shop Tutors website!</h1>
<body>
<p>ZakyD, requests work like this:</p>
<p>go to thisAddress/people to get a list of all users</p>
<p>go to thisAddress/people/idnumber to get user information for someone with a certain id. up until now these have been get requests</p>
<p>go to thisAddress/people/idnumber with a delete request to delete a certain user from the cache</p>
<p>go to thisAddress/people/idnumber with a post request to post a user. the body should look like this (how it looks like when you do a get user request): {\"id\":\"69\" ....}</p>
<p>KEEP IN MIND: this is not connected to the sql server yet so the information will get reset every time i rerun the program on my linux VM so the way of doing it might change for u in the future")</p>
